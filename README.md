# KTANELog

This is a little program for making stream overlays for the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.  The program basically parses the game's log file for state information and writes out three files:

1. Status file -- This file contains state about the bomb.  Also shows configurable success and failures messages.
2. Modules file -- This file contains a list of modules that are active on the bomb.
3. Defused file -- This file contains a list of modules that have been defused.

This code is mostly function, but there are some things and some TODOs left, but hey, the most important part of any code is that it ships!

Start the program before you start the game.  Everything should be more-or-less self explanatory.  Check out the config.json file for configuration.

Special thanks to my stream for helping test and providing inspiration!
